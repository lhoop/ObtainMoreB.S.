## Symbols
Please note that we use k0 to k80 represent new variables in our code,  all recovered superpolys are for new variables. 


'balance:22 ' represents that k22 is a balanced variable in the superpoly.

'20 21 22 64'  represents that this superpoly involves k20,k21,k22,k64.

'allnum:4' represents that this superpoly involves 4 secret variables.


'res_70_52_48_29' represents the cube I2/{70,52,48,29} where I2 is cube indices of the mother cube.

I2 = {2, 5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 41, 44, 46, 51, 55, 63, 66, 72, 78, 3, 0, 69, 6, 26, 7, 50,
68, 25, 48, 33, 4, 21, 76, 36, 16, 14, 37, 38, 39, 59, 61, 18, 53, 34, 74, 40, 1, 57, 9, 13, 22, 35}
