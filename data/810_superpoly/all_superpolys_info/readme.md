## Symbols
Please note that we use k0 to k80 represent new variables in our code,  all recovered superpolys are for new variables. 


'balance:22 ' represents that k22 is a balanced variable in the superpoly.

'20 21 22 64'  represents that this superpoly involves k20,k21,k22,k64.

'allnum:4' represents that this superpoly involves 4 secret variables.

'res_70_52_48_29' represents the cube I1/{70,52,48,29} where I1 is cube indices of the mother cube.


I1 = {0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 17, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 32, 34, 36, 37,
39, 41, 43, 45, 47, 50, 52, 54, 55, 60, 62, 64, 70, 72, 75, 79, 68, 57, 53, 48}
